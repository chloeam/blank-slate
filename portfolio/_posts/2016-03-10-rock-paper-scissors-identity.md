overview: Rock Paper Scissors is a specialty office supply store that sells stationery, office supplies, and basic arts and crafts supplies. Included in their stationery offerings are beautifully designed cards and ready-to-go wedding invitations. They offer products in a variety of colors and styles and are known for their thoughtfully designed selection. They needed a new logo and identity package, including a letterhead, envelope, and business cards. Rock Paper Scissors wants to communicate sophistication, thoughtful design, and an emphasis on quality. They also want to communicate a touch of fun and whimsy, but not at the expense of elegance and refined professionalism.

## The Logo

Rock Paper Scissors needs an elegant logo that still feels modern. I explored dozens of options and eventually narrowed it down to the following four:

</div>

Ultimately, I moved forward with the paper crane logo because it's elegant, is made of paper (Rock Paper Scissors's main product), and stands for creativity, craft, and the process of making.

## Identity Package

Rock Paper Scissors needs a letterhead, envelope, and business cards. All should be elegant, subtle, and reminiscent of paper and stationery. To accomplish the latter, I put a thin stroke around every element and emphasized the rectangular shapes. I also chose a subtle color palette of white, cream, and royal blue.

Because the logo for Rock Paper Scissors is an origami crane, it was decided that the company would sell origami paper in sets of ten sheets. Wrapped around each pack would be a band with the company's identity, information, and address.
