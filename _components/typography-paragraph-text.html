<p>
Here is a standard paragraph with a fair amount of text. <em>This text is emphasized</em>. This is some filler
text so we can see what the paragraph looks like with a bit more text in it. For realism!
We all need to drink H<sub>2</sub>O in order to survive. This is some filler
text so we can see what the paragraph looks like with a bit more text in it. For realism!
<strong>This text is in the strong tags</strong>. 104-72=38. There's a <a>link</a> in here too! <u>This text is underlined</u>. E=MC<sup>2</sup>. Gotta keep that filler text going... even more meaningless words. 
<cite>This is a citation</cite>, even though I'm still not quite sure what they're used for.
To code this site, I used <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym>, 
<acronym title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</acronym>, and Jekyll. 
Do you like it? I think it's nice &amp; lovely.
