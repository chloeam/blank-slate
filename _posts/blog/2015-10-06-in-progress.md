I simply could not wait for this book to come out. I forget how I first heard of Jessica Hische, but ever since checking out her website several years ago I've been completely obsessed. She's quirky, funny, and extremely talented, as evidenced by her massive collection of work. I was so excited to read her first book.

*In Progress* is divided into two parts: process and work. In the process section, Jessica Hische provides insight into how she works: the tools she uses, general advice, and her process step-by-step. I found her tips on vectorizing letterforms to be exceedingly helpful and interesting. In the work section, she takes you through her portfolio and talks about her experiences with the client, what went well, and what she enjoyed about the project. You also see sketches and can compare them to the final work. 

There's not much to say about this book except that it's absolutely wonderful, and I recommend it to any designer or letterer!
