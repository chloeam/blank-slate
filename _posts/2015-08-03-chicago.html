overview: This series was the final for my Computer Imaging class. The assignment was to create a travel poster, postcard, stamp, and souvenir for a city of our choice. Additionally, we had to draw inspiration from an artist that was randomly assigned to us (mine was Roy Lichtenstein). Chicago is a beautiful and intricate city that often feels monumental, especially the first time you visit. In my research, I noticed that Chicago travel posters normally featured Lake Michigan or Cloud Gate, which are both beautiful, but what I love most about the city is the height I see all around me (in fact, the first skyscraper was built in Chicago). I decided to focus on that.

		<h3>Chicago Flag</h3>

		<img src="/img/chicagoflag.png">

		<p>The Chicago flag is a huge part of the visual culture of the city, and I knew immediately that I wanted the campaign to work with that rather than against it. I decided to use the same blue that's in the flag and to use the distinct, 5-pointed star as a prominent visual element.</p>
