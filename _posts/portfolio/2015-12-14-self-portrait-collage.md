overview: This self portrait was the final for my Computer Imaging II class. The assignment was to create a self portrait that represents ourselves by showing more than just our visual appearence. Each image in the collage is a photo I took of an object that is meaningful to me. The hair is made up of scans of my old diary and pages of my favorite books, the facial highlights are paintings I've done, and the glasses are my favorite shirt that I've had for years.
