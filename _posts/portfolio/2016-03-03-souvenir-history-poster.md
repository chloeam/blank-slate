overview: This typographic poster was the final project in my typography II class. We had to take our assigned typeface (I got Souvenir, created in 1914 by Morris Fuller Benton) and design a poster showcasing the typeface's history while utilizing type alone. We were encouraged to draw inspiration from current events when the typeface was created as well as texts written at the time.
