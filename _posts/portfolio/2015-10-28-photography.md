overview: In this introductory photography class, we focused on organization and composition of the photograph without relying on subject for context. We had to use the viewfinder to compose each image, and could only make small tonal edits in Photoshop.

## Positive and Negative Space

For this first project, the aim was to capture interesting positive and negative space relationships, where both are equally activated. The images were supposed to transcend subject and focus on light and shadows.

## Volume, Space, and Scale

For this project, we needed to go to a large, public building and capture images that showed depth and scale. The goal was to translate volume, space, and scale successfully into a two-dimensional photograph. Our professor was specifically looking for people in the foreground to get a sense of the immense scale of the building or space.

## Organic and Geometric Shapes

Here, the goal was to juxtapose geometric and organic shapes to emphasize the qualities of each form.
