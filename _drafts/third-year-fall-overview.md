I was confused at the beginning of this quarter because I hardly knew anything about the classes I was going to be taking. All I knew about Visual Communications IV was that people made an exhibit (I actually thought the class was called Exhibit Design), but it turns out that's just one of three projects. I had no idea what Typography III was going to cover, and I had no idea about Motion Design (would we use After Effects?). I also officially started my minor, which is Interactive Digital Media. You can specialize in a couple different things through an IDM minor, and I chose web design and development because that's what I'm most passionate about. I'll be taking classes in UX (user experience) and UI (user interface design), as well as Javascript and PHP. Pretty exciting!

### Map Project
{:.no_toc}

The goal of this project was to make a map. It could be a literal map, but the professor really encouraged us to make more of a conceptual map. As long as it took the viewer on a journey through multiple points or destinations, it was allowed.

I chose to make a map taking the viewer through the 26 homes I've had from when I was born to now. I've moved around a lot, and the fact that my parents divorced when I was one basically doubled the number of places I've lived. The goal of the map was to show that you can really get to know a person from the places they've lived (both in terms of location and the actual house or apartment) and the memories they formed while living there.

## Web Design I

I was possibly most excited for this class because it was the first class for my minor: Interactive Digital Media. The downside to this class was that it was a basic HTML and CSS course, which makes it literally the third web-based class in a row where I didn't really learn much. I loved the teacher&mdash;he did a great job&mdash;and the course itself was extremely well-designed. However, I just already knew all of the material.

Taking basically the same class in two different departments was an interesting experience. Obviously, the graphic design department taught *their* basic HTML and CSS class in a very different way than the interactive digital media department. In both classes, we focused on code much more than design, but in the GD class, we didn't cover *anything* besides HTML and CSS, and how to upload files via FTP. In the IDM class, we also covered Git and Github, which is extremely useful if you're going to do any kind of web development. My guess is that the GD department doesn't want to push "unnecessary" coding on us, but Git is so essential and so easy (there's even a GUI app!) and I just don't see why they *wouldn't* cover it in the first web graphics class.

So, like my previous two web classes, the final project for this class was to create an online portfolio. I thought about doing that, but I just couldn't swallow making one for the third time, so I spoke to the professor and arranged to do a different project.
