I promised myself that I would reflect on each quarter of design school as it happens, because I love it and it's a great opportunity. I also remember being really curious about what kinds of classes I'd be taking once I got to school, so I hope this is a valuable resource for anyone in that same position. In the future, I'll do one post each quarter because writing about work as you complete it is much easier than writing about it at the end of the year. 

I started off this year pretty sure that I wanted to be a graphic design major, but product design was also calling to me. The classes I took are a combination of classes everyone in the College of Media Art and Design takes, everyone in the University takes, and ones specific to either the graphic design or product design programs. In the end, I chose graphic design because I feel less comfortable working and thinking in three dimensions, and I've loved graphic design for many years.
