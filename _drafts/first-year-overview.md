I promised myself that I would reflect on each quarter of design school as it happens, because I love it and it's a great opportunity. I also remember being really curious about what kinds of classes I'd be taking once I got to school, so I hope this is a valuable resource for anyone in that same position. In the future, I'll do one post each quarter because writing about work as you complete it is much easier than writing about it at the end of the year. Same with taking pictures. Note: spend 20 minutes taking pictures of each project as I complete it, not several hours taking pictures of a year's worth of projects.

I started off this year pretty sure that I wanted to be a graphic design major, but product design was also calling to me. The classes I took are a combination of classes everyone in the College of Media Art and Design takes, everyone in the University takes, and ones specific to either the graphic design or product design programs. In the end, I chose graphic design because I feel less comfortable working and thinking in three dimensions, and I've loved graphic design for many years.

## Fall Quarter

### Design I

This is your typical black and white composition class that all design students in my college take their first year. This was a rough but amazing class. It met on Mondays and Wednesdays; each Monday we'd have a huge project due, and each Wednesday we'd have sketches for the next project due. Each project took about twelve hours. 

We started with line and made our way through shape, form, space, and texture while learning about value, symmetry, composition, scale, proportion, weight, balance, unity, harmony, and [Gestalt principles](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/). I used a lot of paint that quarter.

The first project was about line and how we could represent a variety of spaces with different kinds of line. 

The second project dealt with shape and specifically figure-ground reversal (both the positive and negative space could be the figure or the ground). 


The texture assignment was my favorite because it was so experimental. We had to create four boards: one with tactile texture, one with visual texture, one with pattern, and one with collage. For my tactile board, I poured marbled black and white paint over the board, waited for it to get tacky, and scraped into it with a palette knife. I love how it turned out. It's definitely fun to touch, and it's incredibly glossy. My visual texture board is meant to look like an unfinished cement floor that always looks dirty&mdash;even when it's clean. My pattern board was very fun to make; I carved a stamp of my own design out of a rubber eraser with my X-Acto knife, dipped it in paint, and went to town. For the collage, I played with blending the tactile medium of newspaper in with the white paint.
