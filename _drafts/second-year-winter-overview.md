After a great quarter [in the fall]({% post_url 2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}), I was very excited to start winter quarter. This quarter, I took Visual Communication II (logo design), Typography II, Intermediate Photography, Art History: Ancient to Medieval, and Physics: How Things Work.

I didn't produce nearly as much work this quarter as I did last quarter, but the work I did produce was much more thought-out and deliberate than most of my work last quarter. Single projects took weeks (or the whole quarter), and I've done more work that I'm proud of than I have in the past.

## Visual Communication II (Logo Design)

This is the second in a series of six classes at the core of Drexel's graphic design curriculum. This class focuses on logo design, and I was extremely excited, but nervous, to be taking it.

On the first day, we got assigned fake companies that we would be "working with" for the rest of the quarter. My company is called Rock Paper Scissors, and it is an office specialty store. From that information, we had to write a description of the company, including when and why it was founded, its target demographic, and how it stands out from its competition.

Rock Paper Scissors is a high-end office supply and stationery store catering to those who want their office products to be more thoughtfully designed than Office Max or Staples fare. Over the course of the quarter, I designed four logos for them: pictorial, typographic, combination, and abstract. For each project, we drew over fifty sketches, narrowed the ideas down to three with the help of our professor, polished them using Illustrator, and then chose one to present to the class for critique. For all four logos, we worked only in black and white, and at the end we chose our best to develop into a whole brand using full color.

### Pictorial Logo

I was most nervous for the pictorial logo because representing a company through a single image that can be reproduced at any size is really tough. It took me a long time to come up with my sketches (and I couldn't think of fifty ideas), and there were only a couple I liked. Thankfully, the ones I liked were pretty good. I narrowed it down to three icons to represent the high-end office supply store:

## Typography II

This class is what I assumed [Typography I]({% post_url 2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}#typography-i) would be. We learned how to set type in real-world scenarios, dealing with leading, alignment, rag, kerning, and paragraph breaks.

### Souvenir Poster
{:.no_toc}

Most of the class was spent making posters of assigned typefaces. I designed a 20" x 30" poster showcasing the history and aesthetic of Souvenir, created in 1914 by Morris Fuller Benton. It was a long and arduous process, but I really enjoyed it. We started out creating typographic studies using our typeface and quotations from the time it was designed, and continued with the explorations until we had a good idea for a poster. The rest was polishing. I wrote extensively about the process in my [case study for the project]({% post_url 2016-03-03-souvenir-history-poster %}).

## Intermediate Photography

This is the second of two black and white photography classes graphic design majors have to take. While [last quarter's class]({% post_url 2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}#photography-i) focused on breadth, this class focused on depth: we had only three projects, each spanning several weeks.

### Light as Subject
{:.no_toc}

The goal of this project was to create imagery that is transformed by light. The point is to make light itself&mdash;the nature of illumination, or the visual effects caused by it&mdash;the primary subject of the photograph. The viewer should get the point that the images are about light, more so than about the people, places, and things also depicted.

### Time Revealed

The passage of time is revealed in all motion. The goal for this project was to explore time through motion and use the shutter speed to control the effect of freezing motion and describing motion.

### Independent Project
{:.no_toc}

For my independent project, I decided to photograph intimate and transformative portraits of everyday objects. I am drawn to things we see all the time but do not pay attention to, and I wanted to establish a new way at looking at these objects. I aimed to show an object in a different context or from a different vantage point than how we normally view that object.

## Art History: Ancient to Medieval

This class was pretty boring, to be honest. It spanned about 3 thousand years, which is insane! The thing is though, painting hadn't yet been invented for much of that time, so the first half of this class was about architecture, which I'm just not interested in. "Architecture" is actually kind of a generous word for what we were studying, because most of the buildings we looked at were mud huts and tombs. They all kind of blended together. Things picked up a little once we got into Ancient Greece and Rome, though.

## Physics: How Things Work

Hmmm, one of these classes is not like the other.... At Drexel, everyone in every college must take a natural science. Because I like math, I thought a physics class would be most enjoyable for me. It was okay, but mostly I'm glad I got through it. I really liked everything to do with mechanics, but once we got into electricity I was pretty lost.
