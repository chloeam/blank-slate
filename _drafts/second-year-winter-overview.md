After a great quarter [in the fall]({% post_url /blog/2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}), I was very excited to start winter quarter. This quarter, I took Visual Communication II (logo design), Typography II, Intermediate Photography, Art History: Ancient to Medieval, and Physics: How Things Work.

## Visual Communication II (Logo Design)

This is the second in a series of six classes at the core of Drexel's graphic design curriculum. This class focuses on logo design, and I was extremely excited, but nervous, to be taking it. 

On the first day, we got assigned fake companies that we would be "working with" for the rest of the quarter. My company is called Rock Paper Scissors, and it is an office specialty store. From that information, we had to write a description of the company, including when and why it was founded, its target demographic, and how it stands out from its competition.

Rock Paper Scissors is a high-end office supply and stationery store catering to those who want their office products to be more thoughtfully designed than Office Max or Staples fare. Over the course of the quarter, I designed four logos for them: pictorial, typographic, combination, and abstract. For each project, we drew over fifty sketches, narrowed the ideas down to three with the help of our professor, polished them using Illustrator, and then chose one to present to the class for critique. For all four logos, we worked only in black and white, and at the end we chose our best to develop into a whole brand using full color.

### Pictorial Logo
{:.no_toc}

I was most nervous for the pictorial logo because representing a company through a single image that can be reproduced at any size is really tough. It took me a long time to come up with my sketches (and I couldn't think of fifty ideas), and there were only a couple I liked. Thankfully, the ones I liked were pretty good. I narrowed it down to three icons to represent the high-end office supply store: 

## Typography II

This class is what I assumed [Typography I]({% post_url /blog/2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}#typography-i) would be. We learned how to set type in real-world scenarios, dealing with leading, alignment, rag, kerning, and paragraph breaks. 

## Intermediate Photography

This is the second of two black and white photography classes graphic design majors have to take. While [last quarter's class]({% post_url /blog/2016-01-16-second-year-fall-overview %}#photography-i) focused on breadth, this class focused on depth: we had only three projects, each spanning several weeks. 

### Light as Subject 

## Art History: Ancient to Medieval

## Physics: How Things Work

Hmmm, one of these classes is not like the other.... At Drexel, everyone in every college must take a natural science. Because I like math, I thought a physics class would be most enjoyable for me.
