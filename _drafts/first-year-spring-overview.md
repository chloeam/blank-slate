## Design III

This is the three-dimensional design class that every Drexel freshman design student takes after [Design II](/blog/first-year-winter-overview/#design-ii) (color theory) and [Design I](/blog/first-year-fall-overview/#design-i) (composition). Unfortunately I don't have very good photos of these projects because I had to throw them out before I got my nice camera since they took up a lot of space in my apartment.

## Computer Imaging I

This was by far my favorite class this quarter. I knew going into it that it was technical course where we'd learn Adobe Illustrator. Because I've been working with Illustrator for years, I expected to be bored and not really learn anything. To my surprise, I was learning things about the program by the second week! 

### Robot

Because this was an Illustrator course, we did a lot of vectorizing images. The first large project was taking a photo of a toy robot and producing a vector illustration of it without using gradients or transparent shapes. I ultimately had to do this twice because my first try was not nearly detailed enough. Here is my final:

### Self Portrait

The second large project we had to do was a self portrait. With this project, we got a lot more creative freedom than we did with the robot project, and we were allowed to use gradients and transparent shapes.

### Stationery

For this project, we had to do four pattern-based illustrations that would look great together on a set of stationery. I chose an aquatic theme and wanted to make mine both whimsical and sophisticated.

### Travel Campaign

For our final, we had to design a travel campaign for a city of our choice, including a poster, postcard, and stamp. I chose Chicago, since it's where I had last lived. The campaign also had to be heavily influenced by a randomly-assigned artist, and I got Roy Lichtenstein. In addition to the pattern use and primary colors Lichtenstein employs, I drew inspiration from the Chicago flag, which is a huge part of the city's visual identity already. The elements I chose to illustrate are the John Hancock Center (as Chicago is known for skycrapers and had the world's first skyscraper) and the elevated train, which gives the city a distinct look. The slogan I wrote was "Rise High," which complements both the height of the Hancock center as well as the elevated train.

This was such a great class; I developed as a designer and became more adept at using Illustrator. I look forward to the fall when I'll take Computer Imaging II!

## Figure Drawing I

## Art History: High Renaissance to Modern

I debated whether or not I should even mention this class, but I think the point of recounting each quarter like this is to be honest about my experiences in school. I failed this course, and I failed because I stopped trying less than half way through. The first couple weeks were so easy and I realized I didn't have to go to the lectures to get 100% on the quizzes. Because of this, I stopped going to the lectures. This class became my lowest priority, and I stopped showing up for the quizzes. I was too embarassed to go speak to the professor, so I just sort of... let it happen. Somewhat surprisingly, my advisor said this happens with Art History relatively frequently. Students don't care about it, or think it's easier than it is, and they just stop trying. Ultimately, I'll have to take this class again (in addition to one more required Art History course), and I've definitely learned my lesson.

## Non-Design Classes

### Internship in Literary Publishing

This was an internship, but because it was run by a Drexel organization and I was paid in class credit, it's listed as a class on my transcript. During spring quarter, I blogged two or three times each week for [5027mac](http://www.5027mac.org/), Drexel's news and culture blog. I was also a reader for [Painted Bride Quarterly](http://pbq.drexel.edu/), one of the nation's oldest literary magazines. It was really nice to have a steady reason to write, and I genuinely enjoyed the work. It took a lot of work though, so I don't when I can do it again in the future.

### Civic Engagement

Every Drexel student must take Civic Engagement: our version of community service. We meet once per week to discuss what it means to volunteer and be a part of a community, and we volunteer for ten hours throughout the quarter for an organization of our choice. Because I love kids and tutoring, I worked with [US Dream Academy](http://www.usdreamacademy.org/).
