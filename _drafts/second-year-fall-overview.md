I was so excited to start this school year. Last year, most of my classes were outside my major, but this year that completely changed. Having a foundation year to learn the basics of design before you get into the specifics of your chosen field is pretty typical of art or design school. I was just so excited to finally start taking these classes!

## Visual Communications I

This class is somewhat similar to Design I from last year, but it's a little more specialized. It focuses on black and white compositions using only lines and dots. We reviewed Gestalt Principles (and I actually understood them this time),

## Typography I

I was so stoked for this class! Typography is a huge component of graphic design, and I felt I had learned as much about it as I could without taking a class, so I was excited to get a formal education in it.

## Computer Imaging II

## Photography I

This black and white digital photography course was all about learning the basics and starting to explore. In the very first class we went over how to properly expose a photo by adusting shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, and I was completely overwhelmed. 

## Art History: High Renaissance to Modern
