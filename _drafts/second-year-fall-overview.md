I was so excited to start this school year. Last year, most of my classes were outside my major. Having a foundation year to learn the basics of design before you get into the specifics of your chosen field is pretty typical of art or design school. This year however, I dove into graphic design! Three out of five of my classes were in the graphic design department, and the other two were art classes of some sort.

## Visual Communications I

This class is somewhat similar to Design I from last year in that they both focus on abstract black and white compositions, but Visual Communications is a little more specialized. On the first day, my professor kept saying that we were learning a new language&mdash;how to communicate abstract concepts visually.

This class would also place a heavy focus on craft, as we were producing these compositions by hand using nothing but black pens and gouache. 

### Line and Dot Series
{:.no_toc}

This was a series of twelve compositions and one twenty-second gif animation portraying concepts using just black and white dots and lines. We got a list of words, including "misanthropic", "lively", and "rebuke", and had to communicate those words abstractly. First, we used black and white dots only, and we had to use exactly five. I depicted "heavy", "choke", erupt", and "emerge".

Next, we had to use lines only. I portrayed "acclivity", "cadence", "decelerate", and "forlorn".

We then got to use lines and dots and could choose our own words. I thought using lines and dots together would be easier, but it was actually much more difficult for me. I did "grow", "attack", "bounce", and "protrude". 

We tied it all together with a twenty-second animation on one of the compositions. I chose to animate "grow." We were supposed to make a gif animation using Photoshop, but I grew frustrated with it and decided to learn Adobe After Effects instead. I really enjoyed that.

### Object Series
{:.no_toc}

For the second series in the class, we abstracted common mechanical objects. I chose a whisk as I was attracted to its curved forms. 

### Architecture Series
{:.no_toc}

For the last series in the class, we had two 18"x24" poster projects inspired by the work of an assigned architect. I got Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, a German-American architect whose personal motto is "less is more." I selected his Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin as inspiration for my posters.

<img src="/img/viscom-1/nationalgalerie.jpg" alt="Mies's Berlin Neue Nationalgalerie">

For the first poster, we could use only line and dot. We had to use at least one of each, and there was a maximum of ten each. Because Mies doesn't incorporate any curves into his work, I was worried about including circles. In most of my sketches, I had one circle sneakily included as the base of a column or a light fixture. Later however, I realized I didn't want to shy away from that challenge and decided to make the ground a large circle. Additionally, the ends of the columns and the roof imply a second circle.

<img src="/img/viscom-1/arch_dot_line.jpg" alt="Dot and line architectural poster">

The second poster is comprised of type. We could choose any word related to the architect or building and use each letter in that word exactly once. I chose "Mies," and went for an abstract approach similar to my dot and line poster.

This class was absolutely one of my favorites this quarter. I learned so much about communicating complex ideas with simple visual elements, and I know focusing on craft to an extreme degree will carry over into the rest of my work, even though I'm (thankfully) done using gouache for the foreseeable future.

## Typography I

I was so stoked for this class! Typography is a huge component of graphic design, and I felt I had learned as much about it as I could without taking a class, so I was excited to get a formal education in it. This class focused mainly on seeing type as shapes rather than letters with inherent meaning behind them.

Our professor was very into process, so all of our projects showed an expanded idea broken down into stages of development.

### Type Combinations
{:.no_toc}

For our first project, we created two-letter typographic marks. For the first stage, we had to use Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Clarendon, and Futura to make letter pairs highlighting either the letters' similarities or differences. We then picked our favorites and continued to refine them until we got something that looked like it could be a logo. I made two: one more serious and the other whimsical.

### Structure and Chaos
{:.no_toc}

The rest of the class focused on expressive typography compositions based around the ideas of structure and chaos. 

For the first project, we created three free-form compositions for structure and chaos each, using those words in the compositions. The first had to use ten words, and the other two had to use many more, but be based on that first composition. I absolutely loved this project.

<img src="/img/typography-1/chaos-scale-2.jpg" alt="">

<img src="/img/typography-1/chaos-scale-3.jpg" alt="">

The second project was about adapting shape into type and creating interesting textures. We created line and dot compositions (line for structure, dot for chaos) and translated them into five compositions using type, increasing in complexity.

<img src="/img/typography-1/chaos-dot-4.jpg" alt="">

<img src="/img/typography-1/chaos-dot-5.jpg" alt="">

For the last project, we translated photos into a type composition. We took the photos ourselves, and they had to show either a structured system or a chaotic one. I took a picture of my mom's kitchen. We then translated the photos into black and white compositions using simple shapes, and adapted those into type compositions. We could use any words we wanted this time, but they had to be related to the photo. In the end, I had three type compositions.

<img src="/img/typography-1/photo-interpretation-4.jpg" alt="">

<img src="/img/typography-1/photo-interpretation-5.jpg" alt="">

This class certainly wasn't what I was expecting. I was surprised to focus so much on typographic compositions as opposed to learning about typography and placing type into more real-world scenarios. Still, the compositions were fun to produce and I definitely got more comfortable working with type.

## Computer Imaging II

This is the second class in a series of three technical classes in the Adobe software. The [first taught us Illustrator]({% post_url /blog/2015-09-10-first-year-spring-overview %}#computer-imaging-i), and this one taught us Photoshop. On the first day, our professor emphasized that he wasn't so much teaching us Photoshop as he was teaching us how to be comfortable learning how to use the software on our own. He'd show us the basics, and it's up to us to do the rest. 

We started off with a ton of lectures and exercises meant to familiarize us with Photoshop and digital imaging. We learned about color modes, file formats, and Photoshop tools. We'd get a short demonstration in clipping paths and masks, and then the homework was to mask objects out of their backgrounds. The second half of the class was comprised of photo-heavy projects. We had to take all of the photos for the projects ourselves, and it was as much an exercise in photography as it was in Photoshop.

### Type and Image
{:.no_toc} 

For the first project, we drew words out of a hat and had to depict them using 3D type and images. I got "pianissimo," meaning very quiet or soft. I absolutely hated this project because it was finicky and time-consuming.

### Robot
{:.no_toc} 

Our professor told us to take apart an old mechanical object and photograph its parts, but we didn't know what we'd use the photos for. Eventually, we found out that we were going to take the photos into Photoshop and turn the machine parts into a robot. I took apart an alarm clock and stereo tuner.

### Self Portrait
{:.no_toc} 

The goal of this self portrait was to make a Photoshop collage of ourselves consisting of objects and textures that are meaningful to us. The hair is made up of scanned pages from my old diary and favorite books, the facial highlights are paintings I've done, and the glasses are my favorite shirt. This is one of my favorite projects of the year even though it is yet another self portrait.

Overall, this class was really great. I learned a lot, my workflow in Photoshop got significantly more efficient, and I got to create interesting projects. 

## Photography I

This black and white digital photography course was all about learning the basics and starting to explore. In the very first class we went over how to properly expose a photo by adusting shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, and I was completely overwhelmed. But we took at least 100 photos each week, and eventually properly exposing a photo became second nature to me.

Each assignment consisted of taking 100 photos, narrowing them down to 25 favorites, and then picking five favorites out of those to edit and submit for critique.

### Positive and Negative Space
{:.no_toc}

Our first project was capturing photos showing an interesting relationship between positive and negative space. These photos were supposed to transcend subject, so what the photo looked like was much more important than the thing I was taking a picture of.

### Volume, Space, and Scale
{:.no_toc}

For the second project, all 100 of our photos had to be taken in a large public building and show volume, space, or contrast of scale. I chose the Philadelphia Museum of Art because of its classical architecture and the fact that I could pretend to take photos of art while in fact taking photos of people.

### Organic and Geometric Shapes

The aim of this project was to capture contrasting geometric and organic shapes in the same photo.

### Street Photography
{:.no_toc}

This one was particularly difficult for me. We had to take photos of strangers on the street, and I'm a pretty timid person. Because of this, I focused on the composition of each photo more than getting up in people's faces.

<img src="/img/photography-1/station.jpg" alt="">

### Portraits
{:.no_toc}

This project was to take portraits of people we knew. Unlike with street photography, it was with their permission and we could direct them into particular poses. I loved this one, and my subjects are my boyfriend and my two roommates.

This class was hard for me becuase I was working with a camera in a way I never had before, but I really enjoyed my shooting sessions each week. I'm looking forward to my intermediate photography class winter quarter.

## Art History: High Renaissance to Modern

I had this class once each week for three hours, and boy did it feel like three hours. But the material was somewhat interesting, and I generally like art history. At Westphal, everyone needs to take three introductory art history classes, and now I've got one left.
