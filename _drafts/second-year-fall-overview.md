I was so excited to start this school year. Last year, most of my classes were outside my major. Having a foundation year to learn the basics of design before you get into the specifics of your chosen field is pretty typical of art or design school. This year however, I dove into graphic design! Three out of five of my classes were in the graphic design department, and the other two were art classes of some sort. 

## Visual Communications I

This class is somewhat similar to Design I from last year in that they both focus on abstract black and white compositions, but Visual Communications is a little more specialized. On the first day, my professor kept saying that we were learning a new language&mdash;how to communicate abstract concepts visually.

This class would also place a heavy focus on craft, as we were producing these compositions by hand using nothing but black pens and gouache. 

### Line and Dot Series
{:.no_toc}

This was a series of twelve compositions and one twenty-second animation portraying concepts using just black and white dots and lines. We got a list of words, including "misanthropic", "lively", and "rebuke", and had to communicate those words abstractly. First, we used black and white dots only, and we had to use exactly five. I had "heavy", "erupt", and "emerge".

Next, we had to use lines only. I portrayed "acclivity", "cadence", "decelerate", and "forlorn".

We then got to use lines and dots and could choose our own words. I thought using lines and dots together would be easier, but it was actually much more difficult for me. I did "grow", "attack", "bounce", and "protrude". 

We tied it all together with a twenty-second animation on one of the compositions. I chose to animate "grow."

## Typography I

I was so stoked for this class! Typography is a huge component of graphic design, and I felt I had learned as much about it as I could without taking a class, so I was excited to get a formal education in it. This class focused on mainly on seeing type as shapes rather than letters with inherent meaning behind them.

### Type Combinations

For our first project, we created two-letter typographic marks. For the first stage, we had to use Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Clarendon, and Futura to make letter pairs highlighting either the letters' similarities or differences. We then picked our favorites and continued to refine them until we got something that looked like it could be a logo.

## Computer Imaging II

This is the second class in a series of three technical classes in the Adobe software. The first taught us Illustrator, and this one taught us Photoshop. On the first day, our professor emphasized that he wasn't so much teaching us Photoshop as he was teaching us how to be comfortable learning how to use software on our own. He'd showed us the basics, and it's up to us to do the rest. 

We started off with a ton of lectures exercises meant to familiarize us with Photoshop in digital imaging. We learned about color modes, file formats, and Photoshop tools. We'd get a short demonstration in clipping paths and masks, and then the homework was to mask objects out of their backgrounds. We got a walkthrough of Photoshop's retouching tools and had to take horses out of fields and remove writing from buildings for homework. 

## Photography I

This black and white digital photography course was all about learning the basics and starting to explore. In the very first class we went over how to properly expose a photo by adusting shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, and I was completely overwhelmed. But we took at least 100 photos each week, and eventually properly exposing a photo became second nature to me.

### Positive and Negative Space

Our first project was capturing photos showing an interesting relationship between positive and negative space. These photos were supposed to transcend subject, so what the photo looked like was much more important than the thing I was taking a picture of. 

### Space, Volume, and Scale

For the second project, all 100 of our photos had to be taken in a large public building. I chose the Philadelphia Museum of Art because of its classical architecture and the fact that I could pretend to take photos of art while in fact taking photos of people. 

## Art History: High Renaissance to Modern

I had this class once per week for 3 hours, and boy did it feel like 3 hours.
