Dry, long read filled with flowery prose. Not textbook-y enough to indicate it's a reference book, but not prosy enough to indicate it should be read in one sitting. Bringhurst's writing sits in the purgatory between prose and didactic, leaving no indication as to whether this book should be read cover-to-cover or used for reference. It's awfully dry to read straight through, but the sparse table of contents leads me to believe that it's meant to be and we're just supposed to suck it up.

"Typography makes at least two kinds of sense, if it makes any sense at all. It makes visual sense and historical sense" -9

"By all means break the rules, and break them beautifully, deliberately and well" -10

"Typography is a living cultural inheritance, which each new generation hopes to enrich" -11

"In a world rife with unsolicited messages, typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it has drawn." -17

"Well-chosen words deserve well-chosen letters" -18

Typography is "the task of creative non-interference" -19

Make the visual relationship between the text and other elements (pictures, captions, notes, etc.) a reflection of their real realtionship. -21

Use a single word space between sentences -29

How to deal with:
Kerning
Ititials (space between letters)
Letter spacing
Tracking
In-line numerals
Paragraph indents
