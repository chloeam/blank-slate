In the winter quarter of my second year at design school, I took a logo design class. I was insanely nervous for this class because I knew logo design was hard and I didn't think I'd be good at it. I thought I'd hate the class. Instead, it became my favorite class of the year.

On the first day, it was explained to us that we would be designing four logos for a fictional company. We drew names out of a hat, and my slip of paper said "Rock Paper Scissors: specialty office supplies." It was up to us to do the rest. The four logos we'd design were: a pictorial logo (or icon), a typographic logo with our company's initials, a logo that combined type with image, and an abstract logo. We would start each process with at least 50 sketches, then meet with our professor to narrow it down to three good ideas. We'd then turn those three ideas into polished logos, present them to the class for critique, and then select our best one to further refine, present to the class again, and turn in for a grade.

## Design Brief

Our first step was to further define our company. Who is the target customer? Who is the competition? How does my company stand out from the competition? All of these questions are important to ask before embarking on a rebrand. I wrote the following brief on behalf of Rock Paper Scissors:

Rock Paper Scissors is a specialty office supply store that sells stationery, office supplies, and basic arts and crafts supplies. Included in their stationery offerings are beautifully designed cards and ready-to-go wedding invitations. They offer products in a variety of colors and styles and are known for their thoughtfully designed selection.

Rock Paper Scissors was founded by Laura Davenport, a product designer, in 2003 in Seattle, Washington. It started as a small store to sell the kind of products she was personally interested in designing and later began to expand as it grew more successful. Davenport created the first store because she was frustrated with the offerings of office supply stores with regard to quality and design. She created Rock Paper Scissors to fill the hole in the market for slightly higher-end office supplies. Each retail location features products designed by Davenport and likeminded designers.

Being an office supply store, Rock Paper Scissors’s main competition is Staples and Office Depot. But Rock Paper Scissors sells products that are more thoughtfully designed than its competitors’ and that are of a higher quality, meant to last. Rock Paper Scissors is not a big-box store, and one wouldn’t go there to purchase a printer, office chair, or desk. Instead, Rock Paper Scissors specializes in beautiful stationery and pens, high-quality office supplies in a variety of colors, and basic arts and crafts supplies such as scrapbooking papers, adult coloring books, and nice markers.

Headquartered in Seattle Washington, Rock Paper Scissors has ten retail locations&mdash;all in metropolitan areas and mostly concentrated on the two coasts. There are stores in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York City, and Providence, RI. The next location to open will be in Washington DC. Rock Paper Scissors has 312 employees and tends to attract bright, young workers who care about aesthetics.

Rock Paper Scissors’s target customer is female, 25-60, has a college degree, and makes at least $80K/year. This customer values design and quality, preferring Target to Walmart,  Crate and Barrel to IKEA, and Whole Foods to other grocery stores. The public comes in contact with Rock Paper Scissors through its storefronts as well as its large online store with a wider selection. For advertising, Rock Paper Scissors relies on word of mouth, digital ads, and print campaigns in local cities.

Rock Paper Scissors wants to communicate sophistication, thoughtful design, and an emphasis on quality. It also wants to communicate a touch of fun and whimsy, but not at the expense of elegance and refined professionalism.
