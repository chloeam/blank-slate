Today more than ever before, education is open source. Because of this, anyone with an internet connection, an interest, and a strong desire can learn design. This has a lot of people wondering whether a formal art or design education is still worth it. In this business, it's your portfolio that gets you the job, right? 

I've seen countless blog posts and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLNCpx-mkLY) that all say the same thing: if you try hard enough, you can get the exact same results without going to college and racking up debt. They say that design schools don't provide you with anything you can't find on your own, and tons of people make it without degrees. While these people make some solid points, I can't help but notice that most of them didn't go to college themselves (I can't find many who went and thought it was a complete waste of time and money). They're also wrong about what college can provide you.

## Disclaimer: College Isn't Everything

When our parents were growing up, a college degree was pretty much a one-way ticket to upper-middle-class bliss. Obviously, times have changed. You can get a degree and still be completely unsuccessful in your field, and you can be successful without a degree. 

College also isn't for everyone. As someone who really struggled in the first school she chose and considered not even finishing, I get this. But the fact that college isn't right for everyone doesn't mean that it's not extremely beneficial for many.

So for the purposes of this post, I'm only going to be talking about why college is beneficial for those who have decided to be designers and have the possibility of paying for school. 

## It's a One-Stop Shop

Entering a college design program is still, to my knowledge, the only way to get a complete design education in one place. Other people have done the hard work of figuring out not only how to teach important design skills, but what those skills are. If you want to learn them without going to college, you'll have to first figure out which skills are important to you, and then search for various places to learn them. With a formal design program, this work has been done for you and all you need to do is sign up for classes.

## Constant Feedback Fosters Growth

A huge component of developing into a designer is getting feedback on your work so you can continue to grow and improve. Without feedback, we become stagnant and struggle with the same roadblocks over and over again until, if we're lucky, we finally break through. But in a design program, you get constant feedback on your work both from your peers and trained professors in the form of critiques. You hang your work up on the wall, present it, and everyone in the room gives you ideas on how you can improve it. In almost every piece I've submitted for critique, I've been stuck. I've taken it as far as I can and simply can't think of anything to make it better. After critique, however, I am full of ideas and renewed inspiration.

Yes, it's possible to get feedback on your own, but you need to actively seek it out and it's a lot harder to find.

A lot of people also forget that design isn't a technical field. Yes, you need to be comfortable with technology and learn several programs, but most of the work happens in your head or in a sketchbook. Thinking knowing Photoshop makes you a designer is like thinking knowing Microsoft Word makes you a writer. We're talking about tools, not disciplines. Now anyone can learn Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign without taking formal classes, but it's much harder to develop a design *sensibility* without constant feedback and being around others who are doing the same thing. Which brings me to my next point:

## Learning with Others Makes You Better

Having other people around who are doing the same things you are is helpful in every step of the process. For one, it's motivational. When I don't want to work and would rather go home, all I have to do is walk into the design computer lab, see my classmates working, and I feel ready to do the same. When it's getting late, we talk and blast music and have fun while we work. There's a comraderie in sharing a workspace that is truly motivational. My classmates make me a much harder worker than I would be if I were off on my own. I am also pushed to be better when I catch a glimpse of a classmate's work and see how amazing it is. I get the drive to make my own work better. 

## Resources

I go to a design college within a larger university, and the resources I have access to are incredible. Brand new iMacs, each hooked up to a large Epson printer fill every classroom, and there's a large-format print center (which we use *all the time*) just a floor below my classes. I have access to a laser cutter and 3D printer, and there are people whose job it is to teach me how to use those tools if I ever need help. I have an academic advisor who helps me navigate the University's system and choose the best classes for what I want to accomplish, and I can take design classes abroad if I'd like.
