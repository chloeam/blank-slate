Today more than ever before, education is open source. Because of this, anyone with an internet connection, an interest, and drive can learn design. This has a lot of people wondering whether a formal art or design education is still worth it. In this business, it's your portfolio that gets you the job, right? 

I've seen countless blog posts and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLNCpx-mkLY) that all say the same thing: if you try hard enough, you can get the exact same results without going to college and be debt-free. They say that design schools don't provide you with anything you can't find on your own, and tons of people make it without degrees. While these people make some solid points, I can't help but notice that most of them didn't go to college themselves (I can't find many who went and thought it was a complete waste of time and money). They're also wrong about what college can provide you.

## Disclaimer: College Isn't Everything

When our parents were growing up, a college degree was pretty much a one-way ticket to upper-middle-class bliss. Obviously, times have changed. You can get a degree and still be completely unsuccessful in your field, and you can be successful without a degree. 

College also isn't for everyone. As someone who really struggled in the first school she chose and considered not even finishing, I get this. But the fact that college isn't right for everyone doesn't mean that it's wrong for everyone, or isn't beneficial for a lot of people.
